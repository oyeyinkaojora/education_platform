<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,755
<i>We need to figure out who kidnapped me.</i>

3
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:06,490
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

4
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:07,959
AMENADIEL: <i>Lucifer,
I'm not angry with you,</i>

5
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:09,885
<i>that you somehow got your wings back,</i>

6
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:11,487
<i>or even that you cut them off again.</i>

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,463
<i>I was tested once, and I failed.</i>

8
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:14,674
I'm not gonna fail again.

9
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:17,194
I suppose this won't bother you.

10
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:18,487
But you cut them off.

11
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,789
The pesky things seem to be

12
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,732
a bit more tenacious this time around.

13
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:22,968
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

14
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,403
DAN: Heard a lot about you, Lieutenant,

15
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:26,171
and I'm really excited to work with you.

16
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,030
Aren't you that corrupt
cop that got off easy?

17
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:28,869
Excuse me?

18
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:30,272
People come to me to ask for favors,

19
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:32,413
and more often than
not, I'm happy to oblige.

20
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,460
What do you get?

21
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:35,646
Simply to be repaid at a later date.

22
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:38,316
A devilish IOU, if you will.

LUCIFER: <i>Who's the Sinnerman?</i>

24
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,187
That's who hired me to kidnap you.

25
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,744
He's a scary dude. Huge crime boss.

26
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:45,955
And where do I find him?

00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,741

Uh, my apologies.

45
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,236
And for the record,
I don't usually suffer

46
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:33,772

[grunts, chuckles]

48
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:38,134
Right. Now, where were we?

49
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:40,145
No, keep them out.

50
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:43,315
I'm totally into cosplay.

51
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,835
I could dress up as a devil
and make it really sexy.

52
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:51,127
I have no desire to
have sex with myself.

53
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,627
Not right now, at least.

54
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,160
Where are you going?

55
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,329
To do some grooming.

56
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:59,718
[sighs]

57
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,968
I'd recommend you leave. Now.

58
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,270
I'm about to engage in
a rather gruesome form

59
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,705
of manscaping.

60
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,340
LINDA: <i>You cut them off, didn't you?</i>

61
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,242
I did, yes.

62
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:12,477
But then they grew back,
so I cut them off again.

63
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,079
It's like whack-a-mole back there.

64
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:15,580
[chuckles]

65
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,048
I'm worried about you.

66
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,552
What you're describing
is self-mutilation.

67
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,255
Doctor, someone is
forcing those wings on me.

68
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:25,023
They took away my devil face.

69
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,827
And I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

70
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,846
Are you any closer to
finding out who did this?

71
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,633
Yes. Well, a little.

72
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,902
He calls himself "The Sinnerman."

73
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:38,570
From what I can gather,

74
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,072
he's a criminal mastermind
who just moved his operation

75
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,842
to Los Angeles, but no one
seems to have ever met him,

76
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,622
which makes punching him in the
face frustratingly difficult.

77
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,813
Well, maybe... [groans]

78
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,048
Doctor,

79
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,105
are you sure you're all
right to be back at work?

80
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:53,674
I mean, it really hasn't been that long

81
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:54,818
since Mum flambéed you.

82
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,955
Yes. It certainly was a...

83
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,790
traumatic experience.

84
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,092
Fortunately, I'm trained to
deal with that sort of thing,

85
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,440
and I'm doing just that.

86
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,576
And there's nothing I can do to help?

87
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,965
Yes. You can let me get back to you.

88
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,900
Oh, if you insist.

89
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:12,671
Oh, I haven't even told
you the worst part, have I?

90
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,539
Not only did he stick my wings back on

91
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,243
and take my face, he's
stolen my shtick as well.

92
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,544
He gives out favors to people

93
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,213
for a price to be named later.

94
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:22,881
Sound familiar?

95
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:27,385
Lucifer, you didn't invent
the idea of giving out favors.

96
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:30,222
[chuckles] Yep, forgot
who I was talking to.

97
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:32,197
I suppose you did.

98
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,593
But you haven't given
out favors in a while.

99
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,127
And the Sinnerman knows it.

100
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,854
I think he's taunting me.

101
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,431
Do you think he's human?

102
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,999
Or something else?

103
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,701
I don't know.

104
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:46,002
But whatever he is, I'm gonna
stop at nothing to find him.

105
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,237
CHLOE: We found him.

106
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,229
LUCIFER: Who? The missing link?

107
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:51,309
Proof of human-rodent copulation.

108
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,711
It's Mike Alonso.

109
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:54,843
The guy that skewered your
kidnapper under the pier.

110
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:57,015
[scoffs] This is clearly
not the Sinnerman.

111
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,984
Clearly not, since I'm pretty sure

112
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:01,489
that no one with that
name actually exists.

113
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,922
He had motive, no alibi,

114
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,790
and, oh, yeah, he confessed

115
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,795
under interrogation. He's our guy.

116
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,799
Well, then he must be
working for the Sinnerman.

117
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:12,130
You're not gonna drag me

118
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:14,330
into whatever new weird drama this is.

119
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,380
And could you please

120
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:17,107
stop saying "Sinnerman"?

121
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,544
Sinnerman.

122
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,919
Big Nina Simone fan?

123
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,807
- Well, actually, I am. But I was just saying
- What? Nothing.

124
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,708
- to the detective...
- Nothing. It's nothing.

125
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:28,346
Are you hiding something
from me, Detective?

126
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,932
No.

127
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,668
I don't care, I was just asking.

128
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:35,105
New case came in, you're up.

129
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,588
Thank you.

130
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,612
[sighs]

131
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:40,023
Okay. Why did you just stop
me telling the new lieutenant

132
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,994
we're on the cusp of the
greatest case of our lives?

133
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:45,344
Because the Sinnerman is an
urban myth, he doesn't exist.

134
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,398
He's a boogeyman that criminals use

135
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,656
to hide their bad behavior.

136
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,059
"Oh, the Sinnerman made me do it."

137
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,728
Yet another thing he's stolen from me,

138
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,992
being blamed for the bad deeds of men.

139
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,696
- He can keep that one, actually.
- [scoffs] So the idea

140
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,966
of telling our new boss...

141
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:01,057
Who I'm just starting
to get a rhythm with...

142
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,293
That you want to arrest the Easter Bunny

143
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:04,550
doesn't really thrill me.

144
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:06,262
I have no intention of arresting anyone.

145
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,831
I want to grab him by his
neck and see what happens

146
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,332
when I squeeze hard enough.

147
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:13,270
If you can bring me
any tiny bit of evidence

148
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,227
that the Sinnerman actually exists,

149
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,773
I will be the first to look into it.

150
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,308
But...

151
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,790
until then, consider this case closed.

152
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:24,006
And let's focus on this case, please.

153
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,148

LUCIFER: [whistles] Daniel?

165
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,010
Guy's name is JD Woodstock.

166
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,548
He lived right around the corner.

167
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,950
Neighbors said he was pretty quiet.

168
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,885
Unemployed, but we found this on him.

169
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,487
Huh.

170
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,062
So what are these? Jokes?

171
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,326
A charitable description, Detective.

172
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,493
"Avocado?

173
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,128
How about avoca-don't?"

174
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,195
Would it be rude to throw
tomatoes at a corpse?

175
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:16,047
DAN: Looks like he was
a struggling comedian.

176
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,968
We're trying to figure out
if he performed anywhere.

177
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,536
What'd he do? Make fun
of the wrong person?

178
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:20,771
Get in a fight with an audience member?

179
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,446
It's worth exploring, at least.

180
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,307
You know, there are a lot
of insult comics out there,

181
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,076
and not everybody enjoys being mocked.

182
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:27,744
Hmm. We should listen
to Daniel, actually.

183
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,594
He's got a unique
insight into this case.

184
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,214
What's he talking about?

185
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,549
Well, they're kindred spirits.

186
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:33,993
A fellow broken soul who puts

187
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,752
the most embarrassing
parts of his life on display

188
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,220
for his audience for an easy laugh.

189
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,453
He does stand-up, I do improv.

190
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:40,756
They're completely different things.

191
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,025
- Oh.
- Improv

192
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,260
is all about "yes, and."

193
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:44,861
Stand-up, well, that's
about telling jokes...

194
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,696
I-I regret starting
this entire conversation.

195
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,857
Wait. Excuse me, Dan.

196
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,100
You do improv?

197
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:52,469
How did I not know that? And how did he?

198
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:53,960
- Well, it's a funny story, actually.
- Actually,

199
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,906
it's because I-I don't
tell a lot of people.

200
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,140
Why?

201
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,675
Yeah... hey, Ella.

202
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,343
How's it going? What'd you find?

203
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:03,513
Well, no murder weapon, but I
did find three shell casings.

204
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,348
Running ballistics on them now.

205
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,251
But, based on the firing pattern,

206
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:11,388
I think this dude was tortured
before he finally died.

207
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,646
Oh, well congratulations, Mr. Woodstock.

208
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:15,749
At least someone cared
enough about your jokes to...

209
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:17,015
ELLA: Did you just say Woodstock?

210
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,628
As in, JD Woodstock?

211
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,963
Yeah. Why? You know him?

212
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,464
Yeah. He made big
news a couple days ago,

213
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,266
claiming Bobby Lowe stole his jokes.

214
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,135
And who is Bobby Lowe? A rival comedian

215
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,637
who hates himself so
much he stole this drivel?

216
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,840
Uh, no.

217
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,475
Open your eyes, pal.

218
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,744
Yeah. JD claimed that Bobby's show

219
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,246
was based on his own material.

220
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,579
And that he could prove it.

221
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,949
Which is impossible,

222
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,486
because Bobby Lowe's show
is all about his life.

223
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:43,553
Wait, so you're saying that
this giant-headed buffoon

224
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,221
stole our poor victim's ideas?

225
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,946
His life's work and built
a business out of it?

226
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,476
Mm. So now he's a "poor victim."

227
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,617
Look, I know you don't
believe me, Detective,

228
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,521
but I happen to be going
through something quite similar,

229
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:56,122
so if I can't get my own justice,

230
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,135
I'm gonna get it for
this poor unfunny soul.

231
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:02,322
Well, I certainly did want
you to focus on this case,

232
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,592
but be careful what you wish for.

233
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:06,392
At least the lieutenant isn't here.

234
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:09,260
You know, if you keep saying
crazy things around him,

235
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:11,065
[over microphone]: who
knows what he might do.

236
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:13,216
Right. When have I ever
cared about that, Detective?

237
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,751
Ah, that's true. [chuckles]

238
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,753
[indistinct conversation
continues over microphone]

239
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,404

240
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,067
JD: <i>I sweated over every joke.</i>

241
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,182
Worked my ass off for months.

242
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:39,218
And Bobby stole it all
like it was nothing.

243
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,556
Created a show based on my jokes!

244
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:45,725
Well Bobby, guess what?

245
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,360
I finally found it.

246
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,759
Proof you're a fraud.

247
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,998
And I'm going to show it to the world.

248
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,170
Well? Which of these boxes
do I click on for the proof?

249
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,472
None. He posted this video
the day before he died.

250
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:01,974
And we can't find whatever
proof he claimed to have had.

251
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,910
So that's why JD was tortured,

252
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,812
so the killer could find and destroy it?

253
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:08,381
ELLA: [coughs] Or he's a liar.

254
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:10,316
Huh?

255
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,684
I'm not sure who said that,

256
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:15,254
but I totally agree with them.

257
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,490
Bobby Lowe would never
do something like that.

258
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:19,025
- Why do you say that?
- Because,

259
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:21,387
Bobby's show is so personal.

260
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,634
It's so authentic.

261
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:24,037
There's no way that you could fake it.

262
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,381
Right. Don't listen to her.

263
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:26,583
The man is clearly a thief.

264
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:27,957
Let's go give him a good throttling.

265
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,427
CHLOE: I'm leaning towards
just talking to him.

266
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,986
And then throttling. I
suppose a little foreplay

267
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:31,971
never hurt anyone.

268
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,039
Wait.

269
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,153
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You guys are gonna

270
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:36,155
go talk to him, like,
right now this second?

271
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,660
Yeah. Why?

272
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:39,579
Maybe I should go with.

273
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,916
You know, to collect the evidence.

274
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,651
- Right. Well, if he's innocent...
- He's not innocent.

275
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,487
If he's innocent, then there won't

276
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:49,989
be any evidence to collect,

277
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:51,724
so probably better if you hang here.

278
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:54,683
Yeah. I-I see what you're saying there,

279
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:55,618
but...

280
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,562
I just think, to be safe,

281
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,704
I should collect as
much stuff as possible.

282
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:02,134
You know, fingerprints, a
lock of hair, an autograph.

283
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,436
Right.

284
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:05,538
To be safe.

285
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,110
Okay.

286
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:08,746
To be safe.

287
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,227
Yeah!

288
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,049
♪ Lipstick stuck on ♪

289
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:17,085
♪ High heels sharpened ♪

290
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,970
♪ Eyes lined, it's on ♪

291
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:22,188
♪ Think it's time to get my walk on... ♪

292
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,470
Hey.

293
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:25,625
Hey.

294
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,926
Yeah.

295
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,628
Thanks for meeting me, Amenadiel.

296
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,963
Is there a shorter version of that?

297
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,366
Does anyone ever call you "Amen"?

298
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:34,467
[chuckles]

299
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,709
Probably not.

300
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:36,999
Oh, you would be the first.

301
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,135
[laughs]

302
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,907
So, Linda, what's going on?

303
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,484
Um, I just wanted to say thank you.

304
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:47,560
For saving my life.

305
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,196
Maze is the one who saved your life.

306
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,497
And I thanked her so much,

307
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,067
I think she's avoiding me now.

308
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,389
But I wouldn't be here without you, too.

309
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,692
I didn't do anything.

310
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:02,061
Other than miraculously
slowing down time

311
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,796
so that I didn't bleed to death?

312
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:05,965
Well, other than that.

313
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:08,100
[chuckles]

314
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,066
How are you really doing, by the way?

315
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,570
I'm fine.

316
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:15,929
You have your powers back.

317
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:17,376
That must be exciting.

318
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:21,514
Mm. Um, not exactly.

319
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,082
They haven't worked since that day.

320
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,618
I'm sorry to hear that.

321
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,801
Ah, don't be.

322
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:29,689
I think it's just my
Father testing me again.

323
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:31,716
But this time, Linda, I'm ready.

324
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,386
How is He testing you?

325
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,269
Do you have to fight someone?

326
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,265
Solve advanced math problems?

327
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:44,064
Well, if I'm right, there's
something I need to do

328
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,938
in the penthouse and, uh...

329
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:49,342
I've been avoiding it.

330
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:52,979
Well, you helped me.

331
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:56,415
Why don't you let me help you with...

332
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,384
whatever this is?

333
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:59,618
Unless it's math.

334
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,220
Oh, it's not math.

335
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:03,274
Then I'm sure I can handle it.

336
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,265
Oh. Severed angel wings in a closet.

337
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,500
Of course.

338
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,635
Totally handleable.

339
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:18,904
My irresponsible brother left them here

340
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,507
for any half-drunk
human to stumble onto.

341
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:26,151
Proof of the divine just
left on the floor like...

342
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:29,389
like used laundry.

343
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:33,786
For some reason, I imagined they just

344
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:35,888
magically disappeared
when he cut them off.

345
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,923
But this...

346
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,828
yeah, this is gruesome.

347
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:41,063
Mm-hmm.

348
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,000
You know where the garbage bags are?

349
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,170
DAN: Hi, Lieutenant.

350
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:52,972
I just wanted to come by and talk.

351
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:54,862
Kind of feel like we got
off on the wrong foot.

352
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,911
Pretty sure we're on exactly
the foot I want to be on.

353
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,747
I'm not a bad guy.

354
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,250
And I'm not a dirty cop.

355
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,087
So, you didn't check
a gun out of evidence

356
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,655
that was used to commit a crime?

357
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:13,060
I mean, yes.

358
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:15,242
At least it wasn't a homicide, right?

359
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,863
Well, it, um... [clears throat]

360
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,699
- I-I was... I just...
- Stop.

361
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,168
I was gonna string this along,

362
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,804
but it's already a
little too sad for me.

363
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:26,972
I'm actually glad you came in.

364
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,685
[sighs] Really?

365
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:32,333
I want all the intel that
you gathered on Lucifer.

366
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:34,947
Why would I have any intel on Lucifer?

367
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,715
Because when he first
started working with Decker,

368
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,284
you were still married to her.

369
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:40,068
And I'm guessing you broke the rules

370
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,959
and dug up everything you could on him.

371
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,493
[laughs]

372
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:45,820
I didn't. I mean...

373
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:49,628
Yeah. I did.

374
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,065
I'd like it all on my desk in an hour.

375
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,803
That's the biggest cock I've ever seen.

376
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,842
Oh, whoa, whoa, excuse me, guys.

377
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,710
- You guys can't be back here.
- CHLOE: We're looking for...

378
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,145
Bobby Lowe!

379
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:07,847
Uh, right.

380
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,261
Oh, my God, please, no.

381
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:10,997
He doesn't like visitors.

382
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,433
Damn, I can't get fired.

383
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,621
ELLA: Oh, my God,
it's really Bobby Lowe.

384
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,790
What did I say?

385
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,725
- I'm sorry.
- No eye contact,

386
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,274
no green Skittles in my candy jar

387
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,977
and no guests!

388
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,532
I'm Detective Chloe Decker, LAPD.

389
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,552
We want to talk to you about
the murder of JD Woodstock.

390
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:30,788
Why are you stopping?

391
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,105
Show starts in five
minutes, honey. Chop-chop.

392
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,207
God, he just called her honey. So sweet.

393
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,109
Is this about that stupid podcast?

394
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,499
You really think I stole jokes? Me?

395
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:40,866
- Very much so, yes.
- Of course not.

396
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,915
- [scoffs]
- CHLOE: What I think is I'd like

397
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,316
to explore his accusations,

398
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,985
starting with where
you were when he died.

399
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,753
[sighs] You know why people

400
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,588
accuse others of stealing material?

401
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,823
Because the others are thieves?

402
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,658
Because they're failures.

403
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,959
And instead of facing that,

404
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,362
they blame successful people like me.

405
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:58,107
- How dare you...
- Uh...

406
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,865
They're ready for you, Bobby.

407
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:03,698
Look, some of us have
important work to do,

408
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,901
like entertaining America.

409
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,637
If you'd like to see how it's done,

410
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,074
take a seat.

411
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,141
Charming.

412
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:14,644
I can't believe it.

413
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:18,181
He invited us to a taping.

414

Wait, what, what?

00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:24,219
No, I can't hear you guys.

417
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:25,021
Come on.

418
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,607
I bribed you with T-shirts.

419
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,334
I phoned in all my best jokes.

420
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:29,525
What more do you want?

421
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:30,626
Oh, yeah.

422
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,528
More T-shirts!

423
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,330
- Yeah!
- Let's try that again.

424
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,466
Look what I got.

425
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,900
Are you ready to laugh?

- AUDIENCE: Yeah!
- All right, guys.

427

Let's start the show.

Yeah!

Oh, there he is, there he is.

[audience cheering]

432
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:57,520
Well, that was the worst
date of my entire life.

00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,555
Oh, come on now, Bobby.

I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

BOBBY: She left before we got dessert.

437

PUPPET: But dessert's the
best part of the meal, Bobby.

[audience cheers]

439
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,434
Well, on the upside, you have
been trying to lose weight.

[laughs]

441
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,204
I didn't say I left before dessert.

442
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:18,556
This is what that arrogant
fraud is so proud of?

443
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,625
[whispering]: Wait,
what's this show about?

444
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:21,928
[whispering]: Oh. Those are his

445

imaginary friends.

446
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,414
They help him deal
with his insecurities.

- Oh.
- We've all been there, right?

448
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:29,224

- Right.

LUCIFER: Excuse me.

450

Excuse me.

451
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:32,778
Time out.

Excuse me.

[laughing]: Sorry.

454
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,626
You stole a dead man's work

455
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,330
and turned it into this?

456
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,854
Get lost, <i>Fraggle Rock.</i>

BOBBY: What do you
think you're doing, man?

458

Stealing your show,

459
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:44,599
which only seems fair
as you stole it first.

Hey, mind your own business, Dr. Who.

461
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:48,604
Pip pip out of here.

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

Right, what have you
got to say for yourself?

Beat it, handy.

- What have we got in here?
- You can't touch those puppets.

Does anyone work here?!

Ah, here we go. All right,
this one looks good.

No, no, n-no, put-put that...

- put that down.
- [silly voice]: What? What?

477
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:18,067
Jealous someone else has
their hand up my butt?

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,051
Actually, this apparatus
is more difficult than...

479
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:23,172
- BOBBY: Seriously, put it down.
- Ah, there's the trigger.

480
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,974
Right. Where was I? [silly voice]: You...

just get down, get down.

[chuckles] Oh, don't worry, everyone.

484
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,108
There's just a gun
stashed inside the puppet.

485
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,520
- Lucifer, put the gun down.
- LUCIFER: Right.

486
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,155
Right. Yes.

487
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,273
Well, at least no one was hurt.

488
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,718
Uh... he did it.

489
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,887
Are you insane? You could've killed him.

490
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,348
Me? I'm not the one who hid
a gun up a puppet's backside.

491
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:01,020
Or have all the puppets
got guns in them?

492
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,223
If so, I'll set my DVR.

493
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:04,426
No. We never used that puppet.

494
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,430
It was my imaginary
friend's imaginary friend.

495
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,527
The character didn't land.

496
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,361
- I wonder why.
- So you hid a gun in it?

497
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:10,676
I didn't think some lunatic

498
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,846
was gonna try to kill me with it.

499
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,147
It's just a flesh wound.

500
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,788
And you admit that it's your gun?

501
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,881
Yeah.

502
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,383
Ah, I see.

503
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,526
So you killed our poor
victim, ran back to work

504
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:21,195
and keistered it in an old puppet.

505
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,529
ELLA: Not the murder weapon.

506
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:25,933
This is a 380, and
the murderer used a 9mm.

507
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,535
All that means is that he hid
his other gun somewhere else.

508
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:30,904
So come on. Prostate
exams for all the puppets.

509
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:33,974
- Lucifer...
- BOBBY: I don't have another gun.

510
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:36,110
I didn't kill JD.

511
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:38,445
I don't believe you. You're a thief.

512
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,547
You took everything
JD had, even his life.

513
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:43,785
So come on, what more
could you possibly desire?

514
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:48,556
[quietly]: I want out of this hell.

515
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:54,690
Every day I come to work, and I
tell stupid jokes with puppets.

516
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,093
Puppets!

517
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,416
SHEILA: Bobby.

518
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,485
What are you saying?

519
00:18:58,488 --> 00:18:59,620
This is a dream gig.

520
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:01,068
It's a nightmare!

521
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,850
You know what the biggest joke is?

522
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:05,639
- You?
- Me! [exhales]

523
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:08,444
[chuckles] It's no fun when
they talk to themselves.

524
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,979
And now that JD's dead, I'm
never getting out of here.

525
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:13,714
What do you mean?

526
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:15,849
[sighs]

527
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,760
He was telling the truth.

528
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,257
I stole his act.

529
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:25,393
I based the show on it.

00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,149
If you wanted out of the job so bad,

534
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:39,109
why didn't you just admit it and quit?

that you were stealing

his act, and they fire you...

keep up appearances,

- Yeah.

00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,771
Because I was getting death threats.

all my jokes are about him.

Any idea who was making these threats?

550
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:17,185
They came from an anonymous e-mail.

551

after JD posted his video.

581
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
So you think the killer
saw it and then realized

582
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:53,356
he'd been threatening the
wrong comedian the entire time?

583

And then killed JD after he realized

he was the guy actually
making fun of him.

708
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:13,729
I don't think Lucifer knows
how much this hurts you.

709
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:15,764
He never does.

710
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,774
And even though he doesn't realize it,

711
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:21,937
everything he does seems
designed to hurt me.

712
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,607
To test you?

713
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,911
Huh. Wow.

714
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:33,081
You're right.

715
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:37,285
It's been right in front
of my face all along.

716
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:39,121
My test is Lucifer.

717
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,790
It's always been Lucifer.

718
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,661
You're very wise, Linda.

719
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,196
Thanks, Amen.

720
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:50,799
- Mm...
- Yeah, it doesn't work, does it?

721
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:52,501
[laughs softly]

722
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:55,237
♪ Ooh ♪

723
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,739

724
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:00,809

[Lucifer panting]

727
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:08,161
I, uh, had a rather
illuminating conversation

728
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:09,697
with our new lieutenant last night.

729
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,199
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

730
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:13,722
Yet. He warned me not to
talk about the Sinnerman.

731
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:14,856
Yeah, he's right.

732
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,428
You sound crazy... er.

733
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,726
No. He actually knows...

734
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:20,128
Cyber tracked all the e-mails
to the same I.P. address.

735
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,331
A comedy club on Sunset
called The Laughmaker.

736
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,019
So do we think he works there?

737
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,581
Maybe. The e-mails were always sent

738
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,051
- Thursday nights at 8:00 p.m.
- And that's when

739
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,235
Bobby's show aired. So it makes sense

740
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:29,670
that that could set him off.

741
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:30,932
Yeah, it's also when
they have open mic night,

742
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:33,322
so it could be any one of
the comedians performing, too.

743
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:34,691
Or a diehard fan.

744
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,068
Either way, they're consistent.

745
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,283
It would make sense that the killer

746
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:38,623
could be at the next open mic night.

747
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,858
Which is tonight.

748
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:41,627
- So how do we draw him out?
- LUCIFER: Easy.

749
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,729
Arrest everyone in the club
and pull their pants down.

750
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:45,264
Tiniest weenie wins, for once.

751
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,748
Or, our guy is clearly sensitive, right?

752
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:49,234
Why don't we use that to flush him out?

753
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:51,537
What, get someone on stage
that'll really piss him off?

754
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,118
Yeah. Yeah, that could work.

755
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:55,641
And I think we all know the
perfect man for that job.

756
00:28:57,244 --> 00:28:58,677
WOMAN: <i>All right,</i>

757
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,740
please welcome to the
stage, for the first time,

758
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:04,144
the devilishly handsome...

759
00:29:04,147 --> 00:29:07,053
Dan Espinoza.

760
00:29:12,142 --> 00:29:14,876
Remember "yes, and," Daniel.

761
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,738
[chuckles nervously]

762
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:25,115
- [man clears throat]
- Hi, everybody.

763
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:27,456
- WOMAN: Hey.
- Hi.

764
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,997
[clears throat]

765
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,047
So, uh... [chuckles]

766
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,266
- Um...
- [microphone feedback]

767
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,068
- MAN: Oh...
- [short chuckle]

768
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,770
Uh, I have a friend.

769
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:38,158
And... he's got a tiny penis.

770
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,875
- WOMAN: What?
- Uh...

771
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:41,376
a micropenis.

772
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,512
Uh, in fact,

773
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:45,547
- his penis is so tiny,
- [woman groans]

774
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:48,150
it's not even a micropenis.

775
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,751
It's an atomic penis.

776
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,687
[laughs]

777
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,768
- [mouthing]
- Because atoms are small.

778
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:56,358
Not because it ex... plodes.

779
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,693
[Dan clears throat]

780
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:01,319
- His, uh, penis is so small...
- Boo!

781
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:03,565
It's a medical condition, you monster.

782
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,468
[audience cheers]

783
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:09,671
- Lucifer... What?
- Can't stop, won't stop.

784
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:11,173
This is much too fun, Detective.

785
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,041
No, no, no, keep going.
I want you to keep going.

786
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:14,309
Copy that.

787
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:15,677
DAN: Anyways... So what?

788
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,658
Next you're gonna tell
us that his willy's

789
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:19,381
so small that when he wants to have sex,

790
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,306
he needs to call out a search party?

791
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,019
- [audience laughs]
- Or that his weenis is so small,

792
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:25,721
it looks like his testicles are giving

793
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,322
[high-pitched]: the tiniest thumbs up?

794
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:28,357
- [audience laughs]
- Huh?

795
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,558
Shame on you

796
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
for mocking the poorly-endowed.

797
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:33,580
- MAN: Yeah!
- LUCIFER: Oh, hold on.

798
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,129
Maybe there's no friend at all,

799
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:37,199
and you're the one with the baby carrot.

800
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:38,900
[chuckles]: What? No.

801
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:41,198
No, I-I... I-I don't have a micropenis.

802
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,068
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with having one.

803
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,506
Come on. Now's your chance.

804
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,508
Show the world your teeny,
tiny, itsy-bitsy baby arm.

805
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,343
I-I... I don't have a tiny, teeny...

806
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,531
LUCIFER: It's okay!

807
00:30:49,534 --> 00:30:51,546
We accept you for
your miniscule manhood.

808
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:54,549
I don't have a tiny...

809
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,118
- WOMAN: Oh, my...
- Lucifer.

810
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,185
What, you didn't bring any?

811
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:59,321
[chuckles] Get off.

812
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:01,423
Or show us your nubbin. Hmm?

813
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:03,659
- MAN: Yeah!
- Yeah. Boo!

814
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,193
[audience cheering, whistling]

815
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,929
MAN: There you go!

816
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:11,099
Oh, lovely.

817
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:12,501
What the hell was that, man?

818
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,569
You undermined the entire sting.

819
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,971
Well, I'd argue you undermined it

820
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:17,706
with your botched attempt at humor.

821
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,708
All I did was throw
a drowning man a tomato.

822
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,243
Oh, what are the chances?

823
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,278
I didn't even want to
do this to begin with.

824
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,882
And I told you stand-up and
improv are completely different.

825
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,417
And why didn't you stop him?

826
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,885
Because I realized the killer

827
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,820
might seek out a sympathetic voice.

828
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,022
He wasn't sympathetic.

829
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,423
He just used it as an excuse

830
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,892
to tell even more micropenis jokes.

831
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,361
There is no way anyone's
gonna appreciate that.

832
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,629
MAN: Hey, man.

833
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,564
I just, uh, wanted to say...

834
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,435
really appreciate you
saying what you did.

835
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,535
- Huh.
- Ah.

836
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,704
Absolutely. No problem at all.

837
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,239
I mean, someone has to stand up
for the little guy, am I right?

838
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,407
Yeah.

839
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,676
Hearing stuff like that just...

840
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,111
makes you want to murder someone,

841
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:57,245
doesn't it?

842
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,514
- Sure does.
- Hmm.

843
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:02,292
Well done, Detective.
Right, just to be sure,

844
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,352
shall I pull his pants down,
or do you want the honors?

845
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:06,888
You're gonna do what?

846
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,956
- Follow me.
- What?

847
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,391
- Come on.
- I...

848
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:12,427
♪ Keep on doing what you're doing. ♪

849
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,896
I don't understand.

850
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:16,998
Having a micropenis isn't a crime.

851
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,835
So you didn't send threatening
e-mails to Bobby Lowe?

852
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,770
No, I did.

853
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,443
Back when Bobby was
nobody, I toured with him.

854
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:26,385
And that's when I figured
he heard about my...

855
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:27,653
condition.

856
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,084
[laughs softly]

857
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:31,324
Um, how would he have heard about that?

858
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:32,771
All the chuckle bunnies talk.

859
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:33,782
The what?

860
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:36,384
Uh... chicks who like to
have sex with comedians.

861
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:37,686
Oh, there's a term for that?

862
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:39,387
Oh, I should get a term. [chuckles]

863
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:41,022
- Oh.
- Devil bunnies.

864
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,451
Oh, no. Lucifans.

865
00:32:42,454 --> 00:32:44,120
- Can you please...?
- Or not.

866
00:32:44,123 --> 00:32:45,956
One in particular, I told some stories,

867
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:48,509
and then, I heard them
as part of Bobby's set.

868
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:49,845
So then, you started threatening him.

869
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,813
I was blowing off steam, okay?

870
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,404
Every time that stupid show aired,

871
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,274
it was like a punch in the gut.

872
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,606
And then you found out that
JD was writing the jokes.

873
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,307
And justifiably murdered him.

874
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:01,043
I forgave him.

875
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,038
LUCIFER: What?

876
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,579
But he stole your life
story and profited from it.

877
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,047
Why would you forgive him?

878
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,191
I don't mind a fellow
struggling comic busting balls.

879
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:12,082
It's when a millionaire starts
punching down that I get pissed.

880
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:14,756
Or that good-looking
jerk from the club.

881
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:16,549
- What? Who's he talking about?
- CHLOE: Oh.

882
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,518
- Dan.
- Oh. Right.

883
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:20,395
- Are you sure?
- [mutters]

884
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:23,165
Besides, JD's life was pretty sad.

885
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,267
I mean, I think his
last gig was a barbecue.

886
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,670
He even made up this sad story
about a warm-up comic wanting

887
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:30,238
to meet with him about a gig.

888
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,307
- [laughs] As if that'd happen.
- LUCIFER: Why?

889
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:35,452
Is telling bad jokes before
even worse jokes a coveted gig?

890
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:36,367
Are you kidding?

891
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,687
You work an hour a day
and clear six figures.

892
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,463
Not to mention, you probably get a role

893
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:41,598
in the show at some point.

894
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,118
- Oh.
- Really?

895
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,575
Do you remember the name of
the, uh, warm-up comedian?

896
00:33:46,578 --> 00:33:49,491
Uh, Shelly maybe, or...?

897
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,543
- Sheila?
- Yeah, that was it.

898
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:52,879
Do you know her?

899
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:54,682
We're done here.

900
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:58,431
What? Detective,
what did I miss? Who's Sheila?

901
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,935
Sheila's the name of Bobby
Lowe's warm-up comedian.

902
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,563
Right.

903
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:11,611
Detective, are you
sure that Sheila's here?

904
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:16,483
Her roommate said that she'd be
here working on new jokes, so...

905
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:18,718
Well, I still don't understand.

906
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,488
She seemed devastated when
Bobby said he was a joke thief.

907
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,034
Well, maybe she's not
pissed off about the theft.

908
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:29,496
What? Well, then, what else
would she be angry about?

909
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:31,231
[sighs]

910
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:33,566
Let's find out.

911
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:35,435
Okay.

912
00:34:35,437 --> 00:34:39,006
[sighs] As if these puppets
weren't creepy enough.

913
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,423
Hello?

914
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,390
Anyone here?

915
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:58,093
Hello?

916
00:34:58,118 --> 00:35:00,052
[sighs]

917
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:04,989
Lucifer?

918
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:09,905
[yells, laughs]

919
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,040
[in deep voice]: Hello, Detective.

920
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,843
[laughs]: Sorry.

921
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:18,213
Well, don't worry. At least
I don't have a gun up my bum.

922
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:20,315
If you're not gonna take this seriously,

923
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:22,217
then you wait here for me.

924
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,637
Okay.

925
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,465
Okay.

926
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,467
Hello?

927
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,603
Anyone here?

928
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:44,841
[metallic clattering]

929
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,049
[man groans softly]

930
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,623
[groans] What, what's going on?

931
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,385
- Is she still here?
- Who? She? Sheila?

932
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:05,894
Did she do this to you?

933
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,396
I told her I was gonna quit,

934
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,898
and-and she freaked out
on me, started screaming

935
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,433
about everything she-she'd done for me.

936
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,202
But I-I can't take it
any-anymore. My craft...

937
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:16,738
Okay, midlife crisis
later. How long ago?

938
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,307
Uh, a few minutes maybe.

939
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,375
We-we heard you come
in, and then she hit me

940
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,778
with the butt of her, of
her gun... in the face!

941
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,813
- She has a gun?
- Did-did you hear me?!

942
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,335
I said, in-in the face!
This is my moneymaker!

943
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:30,285
- Am I okay?
- Lucifer, she's here!

944
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:31,888
- No.
- She's armed!

945
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:38,952
[boards creaking]

946
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,268
Why did you do it, Sheila?

947
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,283
Get out of the way!

948
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:50,502
I'm getting out of here.

949
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:51,839
Well, once you answer my question,

950
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:53,807
I'll gladly let you past.

951
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,113
Why kill and torture a man
for this pretentious hack?

952
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,750
Do you know how hard it is to
crawl out of the stand-up world

953
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,254
and get a gig like this?

954
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:05,335
LUCIFER: But he's a fellow comedian.

955
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:07,155
Why would you kill for someone

956
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:09,124
who stole jokes from one of your own?

957
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,343
So he stole material.

958
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:13,695
Hell, he stole half my
set, too. Who cares?!

959
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:14,863
LUCIFER: You should!

960
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,998
It's yours!

961
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,721
One might say your very identity.

962
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:22,104
Jokes don't make a comedian.

963
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,005
Everyone has an itchy butt joke.

964
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,741
It's all about what you do with it.

965
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,325
What you do with your itchy butt?

966
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,945
- With the joke!
- Oh.

967
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,447
So, what you're saying is,

968
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,716
it's okay to steal
someone's work as long

969
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:36,051
as you do it better?

970
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,478
And take me with you? Hell yeah, it is.

971
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:41,667
- Oh...
- Now, if you don't get out of my way...

972
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,226
I swear... [gasps]

973
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,994
[grunts]

974
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,763
[sighs]

975
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,099
Excellent work, Detective.

976
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,733
Okay, so... how do we
get her down from here?

977
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,414
Daniel?

978
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,649
You're not gonna throw atomato at me, are you?

979
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:09,217
Come now, Daniel.

980
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,753
I only did that for the
good of the case. [sighs]

981
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,688
Also, I ran out, but more importantly,

982
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,290
did you text me to come here?

983
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,092
I didn't recognize the number,
so I assumed it was you.

984
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,527
You didn't save my number?

985
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,962
PIERCE: It was me.

986
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,360
Too much hard work to break
into my penthouse again

987
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:33,696
for a heart-to-heart?

988
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:36,183
I did some digging, and you were right.

989
00:38:36,186 --> 00:38:37,704
The Sinnerman is here in L.A.

990
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:39,350
Oh, right.

991
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:40,852
Are you not gonna take my advice

992
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,485
- from last night?
- Most definitely not.

993
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,021
I thought so.

994
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,947
You brought the Sinnerman's
murderous thug in.

995
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,496
PIERCE: He's all yours.

996
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,965
I couldn't get anything
out of him. Maybe you can.

997
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,315
[laughing]: Oh. Right.

998
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:01,036
So, what, is this you passing the baton?

999
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,938
- Where are you running off to next?
- Nowhere.

1000
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,439
I'm seeing this through.

1001
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,008
But you need to shut your
damn mouth about the Sinnerman.

1002
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,844
We need to play this carefully.

1003
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,531
Let's keep it between us.

1004
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:12,547
- [scoffs]
- The less people who know about it,

1005
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:13,982
the less chance anyone gets hurt.

1006
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,384
- But the detective...
- Has a kid.

1007
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:18,596
She stays out of it.

1008
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,075
[sighs]

1009
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:24,261
Very well.

1010
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,165
[chuckles softly]

1011
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,808
Hello, Alonso.

1012
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,577
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

1013
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:45,981
I know the Sinnerman had you
skewer Sam under the pier,

1014
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,049
so tell me everything.

1015
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:49,985
Who the hell's the Sinnerman?

1016
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,654
[laughs]

1017
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,256
Fine.

1018
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,597
Fine. Let's play a
little game, shall we?

1019
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,034
Look at me.

1020
00:39:59,993 --> 00:40:01,626
Tell me.

1021
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:05,567
Why did you really desire Sam's death?

1022
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,272
I... didn't want my girl
to sleep with him anymore.

1023
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:13,575
And?

1024
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,478
And... that's it.

1025
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,280
I got pissed.

1026
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,749
Went medieval on his
ass to send a message.

1027
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,884
No one touches my girl.

1028
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,986
And what about the Sinnerman?

1029
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:27,088
Man, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1030
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,957
Oh, you must know. Come on, Alonso.

1031
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,659
What about the Sinnerman?

1032
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,227
I don't know.

1033
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,096
You must know!

1034
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:38,253
I don't know anything... I swear.

1035
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,405
[swallows hard]

1036
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:45,925
I believe you.

1037
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,213
LUCIFER: <i>He was telling the truth.</i>

1038
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:53,648
I mean, maybe

1039
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,685
the Sinnerman manipulated
Alonso without him realizing it.

1040
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,287
Or perhaps he was just a
deranged fellow who felt

1041
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,024
impaling a rival lover to death
was the way to his girl's heart.

1042
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,735
It's a bit old-fashioned, really.

1043
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,279
Lucifer, I want to
talk about your wings.

1044
00:41:10,282 --> 00:41:12,701
Oh, bloody hell. They're not out again?!

1045
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,904
So they grew back?

1046
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:18,592
They did... this morning.

1047
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,141
Sneaky buggers.

1048
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:23,374
- You can't keep doing this to yourself.
- Oh, I agree.

1049
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:25,013
- You do?
- Yes.

1050
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,836
It's getting exhausting...
and quite messy.

1051
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,633
No, I need a new solution.

1052
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:33,293
Maybe I should hire someone to do it.

1053
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:36,191
Or maybe your solution is

1054
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:39,961
to accept that, for now,
you have wings again.

1055
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:43,905
What, and let Dad win,
or whoever it bloody is?

1056
00:41:43,908 --> 00:41:45,901
I... I don't think so.

1057
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:51,339
It's easy to let external
factors... define us.

1058
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:52,674
[clock ticking]

1059
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,810
Especially the traumatic ones.

1060
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:58,914
But only if we let them.

1061
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,957
We all have itchy butts.

1062
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,253
Excuse me?

1063
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:06,888
No, it's just something
a woman said to me

1064
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,598
right before I punched her in the face.

1065
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:12,939
It's not about the idea.
It's about the execution.

1066
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:14,796
It's about how I <i>use</i> the wings.

1067
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,298
That's... actually...

1068
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,100
pretty wise.

1069
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:20,568
Yeah. So I'll just tuck them away

1070
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,570
- and pretend they don't exist.
- Less good.

1071
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:25,399
Someone else is giving
favors. Who cares?

1072
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:27,442
I'm Lucifer bloody Morningstar!

1073
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,844
I do favors better than anyone else.

1074
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:33,515
Amongst other things, of course.

1075
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,858
Or at least, I used to.

1076
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:38,229
And I think that maybe...

1077
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,423
it's about time I got back in the game.
