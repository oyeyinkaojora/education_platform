722
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:16,974
Renal failure.

723
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:18,448
The kidney stones you found.

724
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:22,206
Yeah. Looks like the
"plus" in Pudding Plus...

725
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,509
is poison.

726
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,426
DAN: Poisonous pudding?
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

727
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:40,891
So, Simon must have gotten sick

728
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:42,403
from his constant exposure to it?

729
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,983
Well, what kind of idiot
would intentionally put poison

730
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:47,441
- in their own product?
- These two chemicals have been known

731
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:49,716
to fake the appearance of
a higher protein content.

732
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,590
Which is Pudding Plus'
biggest selling point.

733
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:54,156
But wouldn't people eventually
realize that it's poisonous?

734
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,700
- I mean, the company would lose everything.
- Not necessarily.

735
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:58,426
If you have hundreds
of millions of dollars,

736
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,121
and you get sued for
a couple of million,

737
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:02,121
you still have hundreds
of millions of dollars.

738
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:04,281
- But people die.
- Yeah, well,

739
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:07,010
it's the same calculation
the car manufacturers make

740
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,180
when they find out they
have faulty airbags.

741
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,950
Which costs them less, recalling the car

742
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:13,568
or enduring the lawsuits?

743
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,169
ELLA: Yeah, but why would Simon

744
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:17,398
try to sell the formula to
Grace if it was killing him?

745
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,656
Unless he didn't.

746
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,341
Maybe when he found out what he created,

747
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:21,609
he was just trying to stop it.

748
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,294
LUCIFER: And who better to expose

749
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,426
Pudding Plus' dirty secret

750
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:25,928
than their biggest competitor?

751
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,106
But Simon didn't know.

752
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:28,116
The two companies <i>were</i> merging.

753
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,917
Soon they won't be in competition.

754
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,266
DAN: Suddenly, everyone has motive

755
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:32,434
to keep Simon quiet.

756
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:34,221
Adrian, Grace <i>and</i> the fixer.

757
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:35,679
Three potential killers.

758
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:38,258
And as the merged company's counsel...

759
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,984
you represent all of them.

760
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,135
Charlotte, where are you going?

761
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,372
To join the Peace Corps
or donate my entire savings

762
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,572
to an orphanage or build a shelter
for blind, one-legged puppies.

763
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,508
Well, as long as you're
not being overdramatic.

764
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,010
I thought delivering those tapes
would help <i>clear</i> my ledger.

765
00:30:56,012 --> 00:30:58,545
But instead, it just revealed
that I've been defending

766
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:00,048
<i>three</i> guilty people?

767
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,700
- Uh...
- If that's true,

768
00:31:01,703 --> 00:31:03,117
how guilty does that make me?

769
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,489
[EXHALES]

770
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:13,184
This isn't a good time.

771
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,919
I know how you've been treating Dan.

772
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:16,964
Okay? And I want you to
know that I got his back.

773
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,380
- What's that mean?
- I used to see

774
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:21,536
a light in you.

775
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:24,205
But now, I don't know,
something's different.

776
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:26,741
All I see now...

777
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,390
is darkness.

778
00:31:35,578 --> 00:31:38,059
Oh, there you are.
Where'd you run off to?

779
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,054
Just needed to clear my head.

780
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:42,824
- Do you think Charlotte will be all right?
- Yeah.

781
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:45,093
Why wouldn't she be?
That woman's like a rock.

782
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:48,114
Like a very mean, scary, hot,

783
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:49,731
well-dressed rock.

784
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:53,201
Yes, well... you'd be
surprised, Detective.

785
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,535
Okay.

786
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,871
Well, now that we
know all three suspects

787
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,740
have the same motive... money...

788
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:01,042
I looked into the company's financials

789
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,122
to see who had the most to
lose if the merger failed.

790
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,881
And get this... It's none of our three.

791
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,716
You really think I killed Simon?

792
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,852
Lalo, we know you stood to gain hundreds

793
00:32:10,854 --> 00:32:12,844
of thousands of dollars
in vested stock options

794
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,581
once those two pudding
companies merged.

795
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,424
That's a lot of money.

796
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:17,859
For you. Obviously.

797
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:19,994
But, uh, it all would have disappeared

798
00:32:19,996 --> 00:32:22,697
had Simon revealed the
truth behind his illness.

799
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,632
You... you mean Simon really was sick?

800
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:25,900
You knew about that?

801
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,236
Sure. He said he was gonna die.

802
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,204
But I didn't take it seriously.

803
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,807
- He said a lot of things that night.
- What night?

804
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,809
About a month ago, we went out drinking.

805
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,411
Simon got wasted.

806
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,846
He started going off about how Mr. Yates

807
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:40,214
wasn't listening to him,

808
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:42,417
and that people were
gonna suffer for it.

809
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,987
He said something about
how it was his own fault.

810
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:47,588
Simon said that...

811
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,324
maybe he should just end it.

812
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,793
End what?

813
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:52,994
His life.

814
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:54,762
Huh.

815
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,800
I had no idea what he was talking about.

816
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:59,112
And you didn't think
to tell us this sooner?

817
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,334
Like when he showed up dead?

818
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:04,672
A bunch of drunken nonsense?

819
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:06,841
It's not like he jumped

820
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:08,276
into that vat.

821
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,311
I mean...

822
00:33:10,313 --> 00:33:12,980
boiling pudding?

823
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:15,616
There's easier ways to go.

824
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,618
But none so revealing.

825
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,886
What?

826
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,855
What if this was Simon's Hail Mary?

827
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:23,761
A way to expose the truth
that he felt so guilty about.

828
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:25,760
Oh, so you think the man
actually killed himself

829
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:27,428
to lead us to the toxin?

830
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,130
Well, if he did, it worked.

831
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:33,266
The suicide version's
looking more and more likely.

832
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,770
Day before his death,
Simon changed his will.

833
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:36,909
He donated

834
00:33:36,912 --> 00:33:39,173
all his possessions to charity.

835
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:41,542
He even gave away his pet turtle.

836
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:43,244
Huh.

837
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:45,580
And the scuff marks on the platform...

838
00:33:45,582 --> 00:33:48,839
He must have faked a struggle
to make it look like a homicide.

839
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:51,777
To keep us investigating the companies.

840
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:54,522

Richards' office.

841
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:56,123
Charlotte, good news.

842
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,458
It was a suicide.

843
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,360
So no need to worry.

844
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:01,164
You won't be representing any murderers.

845
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,897
Charlotte just left.

846
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,200
She went to meet some clients.

Why do I get the feeling

848
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,932
Charlotte's about to do
something very stupid?

849
00:34:16,331 --> 00:34:18,613
So, what's this about? Why
the last-minute meeting?

850
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:19,747
Yeah, and why here?

851
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:21,582
Didn't we agree to delay merger talk

852
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,852
until after the LAPD
ends their investigation?

853
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,889
We did. This meeting
is about other business.

And apparently there's
a chance I went to Hell.

00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,483
Oh, I know. I was...

00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,519
I was as shocked as you are.

- Charlotte, none of us did it.
- He's right.

about to blow the whistle

doing what he paid me to do.

902
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:38,078
W-We didn't need to kill Simon.

903
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,710
- We kept him quiet.
- A-And just sped up the merger.

904
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:43,082
We were all set to make record profits

905
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:45,460
despite Simon's
nitpicky safety concerns.

906
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:48,234
Yeah. Why would we go
kill him after all of that?

907
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:49,679
Well, I don't know.

908
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,158
Loose ends, maybe?

909
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,927
I'm gonna make this right one way

910
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,196
- or another.
- Charlotte.

911
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,398
Wait.

912
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,834
- Lucifer?
- They're telling the truth.

913
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:03,704
None of these scoundrels killed Simon.

914
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:05,205
He killed himself.

915
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:07,174
A dying man's plan to expose the company

916
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:08,742
and its crimes.

917
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:11,645
[SCOFFS] That doesn't make any sense.

918
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,513
Charlotte...

919
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:15,273
they're innocent.

920
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,007
No.

921
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,458
No, they're not.

922
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,195
Did you not hear what I just said?

923
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:29,765
Oh, I heard. So they didn't kill Simon.

924
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:32,499
What about everybody who
eats their stupid pudding?

925
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,535
They all knew their
product was poisonous.

926
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:39,439
Innocent people are
gonna die because of them.

927
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,866
I've lived my life

928
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,296
finding loopholes,

929
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:45,257
ways of evading
responsibility for my clients.

930
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,149
Myself.

931
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:51,685
Turns out...

932
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:55,188
there are no loopholes.

933
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,357
If you're guilty,

934
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,273
you're guilty.

935
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,393
I understand that you want

936
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:02,829
to clear the red from your ledger.

937
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,398
But believe me, Charlotte,
this is not the way to do it.

938
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,785
Then what am I supposed to do?

939
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:10,762
I can't go...

940
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:13,632
I can't go back there.

941
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,350
Can't.

942
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,429
Then here's what you
need to do, Charlotte.

943
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,226
Trust me.

944
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,393
Thank you.

945
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,063
What about them?

946
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,565
Well...

947
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,400
whilst I was lurking in the shadows,

948
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,515
they said quite a few
incriminating things.

949
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:46,186
Detective, was that enough for
a proper perp walk of shame?

950
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:47,788
CHLOE: Yep, plenty.

951
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:54,890
FBI's gonna have a field day
with these recorded confessions.

952
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:56,859
You may not have pushed
Simon to his death,

953
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,896
but you'll pay for your
role in poisoning him.

954
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:05,007
- Nice win, partner.
- Thank you very much.

955
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,179
I'm just surprised you let
me enter the factory first.

956
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,328
Oh, I figured it was
your turn to get shot at.

957
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:12,165
- Oh. [CHUCKLES]
- You know, you were right about Charlotte.

958
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,100
There's more to her than I thought.

959
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,870
- The things she said...
- Sounded loony?

960
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:19,906
No. Sounded like somebody wrestling

961
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,241
with their demons.

962
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:29,416
I couldn't help but overhear
what you said back there.

963
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:31,585
Sounds like you're...

964
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:34,020
going through a lot.

965
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:35,689
I'm sorry you're struggling.

966
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,023
You're right.

967
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:39,693
[CHUCKLES]: I am going through a lot.

968
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:43,543
But that's no excuse
for how I've treated you.

969
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:46,298
Well, I appreciate that.

970
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,546
Maybe we could meet for coffee sometime.

971
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:53,473
Maybe.

972
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:57,110
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything, Daniel.

973
00:39:57,112 --> 00:39:59,479
Charlotte, ready for that ride home?

974
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,581
[SIGHS]

975
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:10,320
CHLOE: <i>Trixie, can you come out here?

976
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:11,921
Hi, Mommy.

977
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,241
Monkey, I want to talk to you

978
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:18,064
about what happened today at school.

979
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:20,801
Did you tell Miss Morgan

980
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:22,469
to "go to shell"?

981
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:25,405
I didn't technically break any rules.

982
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:27,073
[SIGHS]

983
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,978
You know what?

984
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:34,514
Lucifer was right.

985
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:37,245
The swear jar, it's... it's a dumb idea.

986
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:39,715
Mommy gave you a bunch of rules

987
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:41,788
without explaining things.

988
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,101
The real reason

989
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:45,337
that we shouldn't swear

990
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,574
is that bad words make people feel bad.

991
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:51,512
And I know you don't want to
make people feel bad, right?

992
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:54,919
'Cause the truth is if you
go looking for loopholes,

993
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,822
you'll always find them.

994
00:40:56,825 --> 00:41:00,407
And I can't force you
to do the right thing.

995
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,460
You'll just have to
learn that on your own.

996
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:05,195
So no more swear jar. Okay?

997
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:10,449
So does that mean I get my money back?

998
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:11,952
Nice try.

999
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,249
Would you like to come in?

1000
00:41:19,252 --> 00:41:21,234
You're not gonna pounce
on me again, are you?

1001
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:23,638
Because that was a
smashing success last time.

1002
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:25,507
Come in, scaredy-cat.

1003
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:29,112
After today, I need wine stat.

1004
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,837
This whole "being good" thing?

1005
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,710
Tougher than I thought.

1006
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,541
It's a nice place you've got.

1007
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:38,078
Though, uh, could stand
to nest a bit more.

1008
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,915
I don't even remember
getting this place.

1009
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,343
I hope you like red.

1010
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:46,515
I'm a rosé girl, myself.

1011
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:49,455
Apparently while I was away,

1012
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,499
I bought 30 cases of Merlot.

1013
00:41:51,502 --> 00:41:53,793
[CHUCKLES] Yes. Sorry about that.

1014
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:54,928
Why would you be sorry?

1015
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,830
You're not responsible for my lost time.

1016
00:41:56,832 --> 00:41:58,531
No.

1017
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,567
Yet I can't help but feel...

1018
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,303
[CHUCKLES]

1019
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:05,605
somewhat accountable.

1020
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,279
Is that why you're here?

1021
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:10,377
Well, this strange,
inexplicable compulsion

1022
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:11,978
to make sure you're okay?

1023
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,901
Very possibly.

1024
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:16,249
Dad be damned.

1025
00:42:19,023 --> 00:42:21,123
You spent time with me when I...

1026
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:24,027
wasn't me.

1027
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:28,294
What was I like?

1028
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:32,521
Well, you were...

1029
00:42:32,524 --> 00:42:35,325
quite the handful, actually.

1030
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,161
Intense.

1031
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:38,764
Jealous.

1032
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,773
Hair-trigger emotions.

1033
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:44,177
Prone to making
cosmically epic mistakes.

1034
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:46,679
[CHUCKLES]

1035
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:49,068
But everything that you did...

1036
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:52,539
The other you did, I...

1037
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:55,777
I know that it came from a place...

1038
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,160
of love.
